# Cheshire

This repository hosts the Cheshire SoC platform. Cheshire is a minimal Linux-capable SoC built around the RISC-V CVA6 core. It is developed as part of the PULP project, a joint effort between ETH Zurich and the University of Bologna.

## Disclaimer

This project is still considered to be in early development; some parts may not yet be functional, and existing interfaces and conventions may be broken without prior notice. We target a formal release in the very near future.
